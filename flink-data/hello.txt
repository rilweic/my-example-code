Hello
Iowa
Congratulations
to
the
Iowa
hawkers

That
was
a
big
win
today

I’m
thrilled
to
be
back

That
was
a
big
win

But
I
am
thrilled
to
be
back
especially
on
such
great
news
as
that

that
was
a
big
one

You’ve
been
a
great
school

a
great
team

a
great
tradition

really
an
amazing
job
and
it
all
started
right
here
and
we’re
going
to
keep
it
here

Number
one

right?
We’re
going
to
keep
it
here

The
fairgrounds
so
they
broke
the
record
tonight
in
the
history
of
the
fairgrounds

I
don’t
know
how
old
it
is

but
in
the
history
of
the
fairgrounds

this
is
the
most
people
they’ve
had

So
thank
you
very
much

And
all
of
you
who
are
hard
working
American

Patriots

that
we
know
and
we
love
you
all

as
we
get
there
tonight

millions
of
Americans
are
realizing
that
Joe
Biden
and
the
radical
left
have
brought
our
nation
to
the
brink
of
ruin

There’s
never
been
anything
like
what
has
happened

After
just
nine
months
under
Biden

violent
criminals
and
blood
thirsty
gangs
are
taking
over
our
streets

illegal
aliens
and
deadly
drug
cartels
are
taking
over
our
borders

Inflation
is
taking
over
our
economy

China
is
taking
over
our
jobs

The
Taliban
has
taken
over
Afghanistan

Lunatic
leftists
are
taking
over
our
schools
and
radical
socialists
are
taking
over
our
country

And
we’re
not
going
to
let
that
happen

We’re
not
going
to
let
that
happen

And
you
can’t
say
I
didn’t
warn
you

but
I
also
can’t
say
you
didn’t
get
out
because
you
got
out
and
voted
like
no
sitting
president
has
ever
received
votes
before

The
election
was
rigged

But
as
disastrous
as
the
Biden
administration
has
been

no
one
can
blame
the
great
State
of
Iowa
because

boy

we
did
really

we
did
really
good
here
